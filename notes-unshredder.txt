Notes - unshredder

#  Losing a bit on the right due to division issues; if sample size does not perfectly divide
#    image width.  But may be an issue with shredder, not unshredder?  Yes, can see missing stripe
#    at right edge on nonstandard widths of shredded images.

sample resolution:
#  For instagram-given example, need s_r=1.  For some, res=85-200 works!
#  Suggests a slider from efficient to accurate, stays efficient most of time,
#   but can be adjusted for more complicated images.

Put everything in functions, give it a cli, and auto-test on a batch of images.
  Output to one large image.

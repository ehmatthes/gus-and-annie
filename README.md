A project to automate the counting of glacier ice worms from photos of snowfields.

A friend and I are trying to improve the field method for counting ice worms on glacial snowfields. Most (or all) field studies so far have involved researchers marking out square-meter plots and counting all ice worms in the plot by hand. But ice worms tend to appear for a short period at sunrise, and then retreat back into the snowpack during the day.

We plan to photograph the snowfield in a short period of time, and then process the images for an automated count of all the worms on a snowfield.

So far, the program finds all the pixels that appear to be ice worms. The next step is to examine these pixels and come up with a count, and then compare that to a hand-count for a small number of reference images.
